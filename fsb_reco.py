For example, consider: public static void initLogging() throws Exception { Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(\"edu.umd.cs\"); logger.addHandler(new FileHandler()); // call to change logger configuration logger.setUseParentHandlers(false); // another call to change logger configuration }The logger reference is lost at the end of the method (it doesn't escape the method), so if you have a garbage collection cycle just after the call to initLogging, the logger configuration is lost (because Logger only keeps weak references).public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { initLogging(); // adds a file handler to the logger System.gc(); // logger configuration lost Logger.getLogger(\"edu.umd.cs\").info(\"Some message\"); // this isn't logged to the file as expected }Ulf Ochsenfahrt and Eric Fellheimer" , "LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC" : "This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a non-volatile static field.

This may result in incorrect behavior at runtime, as callers of the get method will not necessarily see a consistent state for the object. The get method should be made synchronized." , "UI_INHERITANCE_UNSAFE_GETRESOURCE" : "Calling this.getClass().getResource(...) could give results other than expected if this class is extended by a class in another package." , "UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK_EXCEPTION_PATH" : "This method acquires a JSR-166 (java.util.concurrent) lock, but does not release it on all exception paths out of the method.

Since methods in other classes cannot directly invoke methods declared in an anonymous class, it seems that this method is uncallable. The method might simply be dead code, but it is also possible that the method is intended to override a method declared in a superclass, and due to an typo or other error the method does not, in fact, override the method it is intended to." , "UM_UNNECESSARY_MATH" : "This method uses a static method from java.lang.Math on a constant value. This method's result in this case, can be determined statically, and is faster and sometimes more accurate to just use the constant.

At this point, the fields of the class have not yet initialized.To make this more concrete, consider the following classes:abstract class A { int hashCode; abstract Object getValue(); A() { hashCode = getValue().hashCode(); } } class B extends A { Object value; B(Object v) { this.value = v; } Object getValue() { return value; } }When a B is constructed, the constructor for the A class is invoked before the constructor for B sets value. Thus, when the constructor for A invokes getValue, an uninitialized value is read for value" , "UR_UNINIT_READ" : "This constructor reads a field which has not yet been assigned a value. This is often caused when the programmer mistakenly uses the field instead of one of the constructor's parameters." , "UUF_UNUSED_FIELD" : "This field is never used.

Elsewhere, it is loaded and dereferenced without a null check. This could be a either an error or a questionable design, since it means a null pointer exception will be generated if that field is dereferenced before being initialized." , "UWF_NULL_FIELD" : "All writes to this field are of the constant value null, and thus all reads of the field will return null. Check for errors, or remove it if it is useless." , "UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELD" : "This field is never written. All reads of it will return the default value.

The code should verify that condition it intends to wait for is not already satisfied before calling wait; any previous notifications will be ignored." , "VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_ARGUMENT" : "The format string placeholder is incompatible with the corresponding argument. For example, System.out.println(\"%d\n\", \"hello\"); The %d placeholder requires a numeric argument, but a string value is passed instead. A runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed." , "VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION_FROM_ARRAY" : "One of the arguments being formatted with a format string is an array.

However, the format string doesn't contain any format specifiers (e.g., %s) but does contain message format elements (e.g., {0}). It is likely that the code is supplying a MessageFormat string when a printf-style format string is required. At runtime, all of the arguments will be ignored and the format string will be returned exactly as provided without any formatting." , "VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS_PASSED" : "A format-string method with a variable number of arguments is called, but more arguments are passed than are actually used by the format string. This won't cause a runtime exception, but the code may be silently omitting information that was intended to be included in the formatted string." , "VA_FORMAT_STRING_ILLEGAL" : "The format string is syntactically invalid, and a runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed." , "VA_FORMAT_STRING_MISSING_ARGUMENT" : "Not enough arguments are passed to satisfy a placeholder in the format string. A runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed." , "VA_FORMAT_STRING_NO_PREVIOUS_ARGUMENT" : "The format string specifies a relative index to request that the argument for the previous format specifier be reused. However, there is no previous argument.

This creates an array of length one to hold the primitive array and passes it to the function." , "VO_VOLATILE_INCREMENT" : "This code increments a volatile field. Increments of volatile fields aren't atomic. If more than one thread is incrementing the field at the same time, increments could be lost." , "VO_VOLATILE_REFERENCE_TO_ARRAY" : "This declares a volatile reference to an array, which might not be what you want. With a volatile reference to an array, reads and writes of the reference to the array are treated as volatile, but the array elements are non-volatile. To get volatile array elements, you will need to use one of the atomic array classes in java.util.concurrent (provided in Java 5.0)." , "WA_AWAIT_NOT_IN_LOOP" : "This method contains a call to java.util.concurrent.await() (or variants) which is not in a loop. If the object is used for multiple conditions, the condition the caller intended to wait for might not be the one that actually occurred." , "WA_NOT_IN_LOOP" : "This method contains a call to java.lang.Object.wait() which is not in a loop.

If this class is subclassed, subclasses will synchronize on the class object for the subclass, which isn't likely what was intended. For example, consider this code from java.awt.Label: private static final String base = \"label\"; private static int nameCounter = 0; String constructComponentName() { synchronized (getClass()) { return base + nameCounter++; } } Subclasses of Label won't synchronize on the same subclass, giving rise to a datarace. Instead, this code should be synchronizing on Label.class private static final String base = \"label\"; private static int nameCounter = 0; String constructComponentName() { synchronized (Label.class) { return base + nameCounter++; } } Bug pattern contributed by Jason Mehrens" , "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" : "This method accesses the value of a Map entry, using a key that was retrieved from a keySet iterator.
